## Core Features:

- Adaptive Question Generation: Dynamically generate 30–35 adaptive questions per assessment based on selected role and subskills. Include multiple types: MCQs, coding challenges, written answers, and scenario/case-study questions. Adjust difficulty in real-time using AI feedback and performance-based branching. Cover 30+ roles, each with 5 subtopics, and each subtopic containing 5 high-quality questions. Use realistic, industry-relevant examples for every question. For coding questions: Support ≥15 programming languages: Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Node.js, Ruby, Go, Rust, PHP, Bash, etc. Provide real-time code execution, test cases, and live server preview for web development questions.
- Automated Answer Evaluation: Utilize AI to evaluate candidate answers conceptually rather than just syntactically. Provide partial credit for reasoning, logical design, or edge-case handling. Generate feedback summaries, including AI explanations and improvement suggestions. Evaluate coding submissions against test cases plus AI-generated qualitative review.
- Personalized Learning Roadmap: After each assessment, generate an AI-curated learning roadmap: Tailored resources, tutorials, videos, and projects targeting individual weaknesses. Track progress via micro-assessments and adaptive re-evaluation. Recommend next steps and optional practice exercises.
- Recruiter Insights Panel: Provide actionable insights to recruiters with AI assistance as a tool: Top performers, skill distributions, and gaps. Role-specific candidate recommendations. Suggest hiring actions based on analytics. Include filters, sorting, and exportable reports. Dashboard visualizations: bar charts, radar charts, trend graphs, heatmaps.
- Candidate & Recruiter Dashboards: Candidate Dashboard: Test history, skill-wise scores, XP, badges, streaks, and learning roadmap access. Visualize skill progression with charts and milestone recognition. Recruiter Dashboard: Role-specific candidate lists, sortable by score, XP, or skill mastery. Access candidate profiles, assignments, AI feedback, and learning roadmap summaries. Admin Dashboard: View all candidates, assignments, test results, and coding submissions. Analyze metrics, generate graphs, and view real-time insights. Filter and aggregate data by role, skill, score, or completion rate.
- Gamified Progress Tracking: Implement XP system, level progression, badges, streak rewards. Display progress charts and milestones in dashboards. Incentivize consistent learning and test participation.
- Firebase Authentication & Integration: Secure Firebase Authentication for registration, login, and role-based access (Candidate, Recruiter, Admin). Use Firebase database to store profiles, assessments, submissions, AI evaluations, and learning roadmaps. Integrate Firebase Hosting and Functions for scalable backend and automation.
- Admin Tools: Admin should be able to add, edit, or retire questions and assign difficulty levels without touching code.
- AI-Powered Role Suggestions: Missing AI-powered role suggestions based on their prior performance, skills, or preferences.
- Real-World Simulations: Include full-stack simulation environments with APIs and databases.
- Advanced Recruiter/Analytics Features: Include cohort analysis, time-based trends, skill-gap heatmaps, per-question analytics; bulk actions for recruiters, and AI-driven hiring recommendations.
- Micro-Assessments & Continuous Learning: Scheduled micro-assessments, reminders, or adaptive re-tests are included.
- Plagiarism / Integrity Checks: Implement code plagiarism detection, duplicate submissions, or proctoring measures (optional).
- Multi-Language / Localization: Multi-language support for global candidates is included.
- Notifications & Alerts: Candidate and recruiter notifications (email, Slack, WhatsApp) for test completions, deadlines, or insights are included.
- Export & Reporting: PDF/CSV export of candidate reports, analytics summaries, and charts for recruiter/admin use is included.
- Advanced Gamification: Leaderboards, weekly/monthly challenges, and career progression suggestions based on accumulated XP/levels are included.
- Accessibility & UX Enhancements: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast compliance, and mobile-friendly interaction improvements are included.
- Security & Compliance: Data privacy controls, secure sandbox for code execution, and role-based access to sensitive analytics are included.
